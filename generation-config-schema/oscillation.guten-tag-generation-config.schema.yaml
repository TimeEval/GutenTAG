    description: Kind of the base oscillation.
  trend:
    description: Trend to add to the base oscillation
    $ref: "#"
#    $ref: trend.guten-tag-generation-config.schema.yaml
  offset:
    type: number
    description: Constant offset added to the base oscillation.
  variance:
    type: number
    description: |
      Variance of the signal relative to signal value.
      This is also called white noise.
      If set to 0, there is no noise.
  frequency:
    type: number
    description: Number of oscillations per 100 points.
    minimum: 0
  amplitude:
    type: number
    exclusiveMinimum: 0
    description: |
      Amplitude of the oscillation (+/- from 0).
      It will be bounded to [-amplitude, amplitude].
  freq-mod:
    type: number
    description: Factor of time-dependent frequency modulation (modulates the sine amplitude).
  smoothing:
    type: number
    description: |
      Smoothing factor for convolutional smoothing of the random walk.
      Depends on the time series length.
      Default is 0.01.
  avg-pattern-length:
    type: integer
    description: Average length of the pattern in the time series.
  variance-pattern-length:
    type: number
    description: Variance in the length of the pattern.
  variance-amplitude:
    type: number
    description: Variance in the amplitude of the pattern.
  polynomial:
    type: array
    description: Polynomial coefficients in order of increasing degree, i.e., (1, 2, 3) give 1 + 2*x + 3*x**2.

  channel-diff:
    type: number
    description: Value difference of absolute random mode values between channels.
  channel-offset:
    type: number
    description: Value mean offset from 0 in both directions for the random mode jumps.
  random-seed:
    type: number
    description: Random seed that can be used for different channels to get same base (random_mode_jump)
